/*
 * In the Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class. 
 * Then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class. At first, 
 * it seems confusing but once you see the implementation, 
 * itâ€™s really easy to grasp and understand the minor difference between Factory and Abstract Factory pattern.
